Problem Statement
-----------------

A multi-specialty healthcare clinic is struggling with high no-show rates, uneven doctor utilization, and limited visibility into appointment patterns. These challenges lead to revenue loss, patient dissatisfaction, and inefficient use of medical staff.

The goal is to optimize appointment scheduling and improve operational efficiency by identifying:

Peak demand hours and appointment trends

No-show and cancellation patterns

Doctor utilization and workload distribution

Patient demographics influencing appointment behavior

Category	Details
Tools Used: Power BI (visualization & data modeling), SQL (data extraction & analysis), Excel (data cleaning & preparation)
KPIs Tracked	Show Rate, No-show %, Cancellation %, Avg. Wait Time, Doctor Utilization %, Appointment Volume (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), Patient Retention Rate, Cancellation Reasons
Stakeholder Roles Served: Doctors (workload & utilization), Reception Staff (scheduling efficiency), Patients (reduced wait times), Clinic Administrators (strategic oversight)
Business Outcomes Achieved: Reduced no-show and cancellation rates, improved doctor utilization, identified peak appointment demand, enabled patient segmentation for targeted reminders, and enhanced operational planning for clinics
Description

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Healthcare Appointment Optimization Dashboard, designed to reduce no-shows and enhance doctor resource utilization. Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI, appointment, patient, and doctor datasets were integrated into a unified analytics platform that delivers actionable insights for healthcare stakeholders.

The dashboard is structured into three interactive sections:

Appointments Dashboard â€“ Tracks appointment status (Completed, Cancelled, No-show), daily/hourly demand, cancellation reasons, and patient retention. Designed to help reception staff and administrators spot inefficiencies.

Doctors Dashboard â€“ Measures doctor utilization rates (booked vs. available slots), workload by department, and scheduling trends. Helps optimize doctor allocation and identify underutilized resources.

Patients Dashboard â€“ Segments patients by demographics (age, gender, chronic illness, geography), tracks repeat visits, and highlights groups with higher no-show or cancellation behavior. Supports targeted engagement and retention strategies.

Key Achievements
-----------------

Implemented a star schema data model with fact and dimension tables (Appointments, Doctors, Patients).

Built advanced DAX measures for KPIs such as No-show Rate, Doctor Utilization %, and Patient Retention Rate.

Designed interactive filters and drill-throughs for exploring data by department, time slot, or patient profile.

Delivered insights into peak-hour demand, reducing bottlenecks in appointment scheduling.

Created actionable recommendations, including proactive reminders for high-risk no-show patients and reallocation of doctor schedules based on utilization data.

Ensured scalability and security, with automated refresh strategies and documentation for hospital administrators.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal of the Business Problem
---------------------------------

The primary goal is to reduce appointment no-shows, cancellations, and inefficiencies in doctor utilization while improving the overall patient experience and clinic profitability. By centralizing appointment, patient, and doctor data into a single analytics dashboard, healthcare administrators can:

Forecast demand more accurately

Optimize doctor schedules and resource allocation

Minimize patient wait times

Identify high-risk no-show segments for targeted engagement

Support data-driven decisions for operational efficiency and patient satisfaction
